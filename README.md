# SaturnDB
An educational DBMS built in C.

The ideia is to write everything in C, except for a few bash scripts and an eventual GUI in Qt C++.

I'm also aiming to write a ODBC driver for it, but will begin supporting only plain text throught TCP and very simple queries.

For references, **Fundamentals of Database Systems - Navathe - 7th Edition** was used to get the main ideas on how databases works.
