# SaturnDB

This project is an educational attempt to build a (R)DBMS in C.

It's purposes are to learn database concepts, exercise my C language skills and build a portifolio.

***So far there is not executable yet.***

Initial development will be done not paying much attention to efficiency or following databases principles religiously, as i'm looking foward to have a simple functional executable as soon as possible. 
Those things will be taken care later.


First versions aim to use simple data blocks allocated in sequence, instead of the B Tree structure used in PostgreSQL. 

The SQL commands accepted will start simple, like basic queries and create/update/insert/delete commands. As development continues, more complex expressions will be supported.

For references, **Fundamentals of Database Systems - Navathe - 7th Edition** was used to get the some ideas on how databases works.
